## About Me

I'm working as a Lead Researcher at <a href="https://www.elitelab.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Lab</a>.

My research interests include **NLP**, **Generative AI**, **Educational Technology**, **LLM** and **Explainable AI**.

I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from the American International University-Bangladesh in January 2024. Before graduation, I worked as a Research Assistant at AIUB under the supervision of <a href="https://recerca.uoc.edu/investigadores/1243512/detalle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Akinul Islam Jony</a>.
